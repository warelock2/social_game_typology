# 🧬 Social Game Typology

> “The most important division in any society isn’t class, culture, or creed—it’s cognitive operating system.”

**Social Game Typology** is both a console-based Python script and an online web-based toolkit that offers philosophically driven psychometric tests designed to reveal deep typological distinctions between different modes of being.

Rather than being limited to evaluating surface traits or culturally normalized behaviors, these tests can also identify *differences in kind*, not merely in degree—illuminating the latent divide between conventional social conformists and cognitively or philosophically distinct individuals.

This is not a personality quiz.

These tests are rooted in a radical philosophical premise: that many people exist in entirely separate psychological and existential paradigms, often invisible to one another. One adapts to the social game, the other rejects it. The Social Game Typology project is here to make that difference explicit.

You can take the test online [here](https://socialtypologyquiz.afobl.com/).

# 🧠 Value Axes Behind the Tests

Each test is built upon seven key social value frameworks that separate “Outliers” from the mainstream paradigm:

## Self-Presentation

- Constructed Identity ←→ Spontaneous Expression
- Describes how much a person curates or filters their self-image versus acting without self-monitoring.

## Emotional Exchange

- Affective Alignment ←→ Affective Transparency
- Measures whether emotional interaction aims to harmonize and soothe vs. reveal and share internal emotional states.

## Cognitive Orientation

- Sense-Making Comfort ←→ Analytical Clarity
- Describes whether understanding is intuitive, metaphorical, and meaning-oriented vs. structured, precise, and conceptually defined.

## Dialogue Strategy

- Persuasive Framing ←→ Collaborative Inquiry
- Ranges from strategic, persuasive discourse to co-exploratory, open-ended dialogue.

## Communication Explicitness

- Implied Context ←→ Literal Clarity
- Captures the range from high-context, implicit communication to low-context, explicit messaging.

## Group Orientation

- Belonging-Seeking ←→ Individuated Navigation
- Ranges from behavior geared toward inclusion, harmony, and group validation to independent behavior based on internal standards.

## Relational Focus

- Emotional Bonding ←→ Value Alignment
- Ranges from forming connections through shared feeling and experience to forming them through shared purpose, values, and direction.
