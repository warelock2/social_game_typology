# ðŸ§¬ Social Game Typology

**Social Game Typology** is a console-based Python toolkit that offers philosophically driven psychometric tests designed to reveal deep typological distinctions between different modes of being.

Rather than being limited to evaluating surface traits or culturally normalized behaviors, these tests can also identify *differences in kind*, not merely in degreeâ€”illuminating the latent divide between conventional social conformists and cognitively or philosophically distinct individuals.

# Requirements

Python 3

# How to use

Run the "normie_vs_outlier_typology_quiz.py" script first. If your result is "Normie", then you're done. If your result is "Outlier", run the second "outlier_typology_quiz.py" script for more greater detail.
