# 🧬 Social Game Typology

> “The most important division in any society isn’t class, culture, or creed—it’s cognitive operating system.”

**Social Game Typology** is a console-based Python toolkit that offers philosophically driven psychometric tests designed to reveal deep typological distinctions between different modes of being.

Rather than being limited to evaluating surface traits or culturally normalized behaviors, these tests can also identify *differences in kind*, not merely in degree—illuminating the latent divide between conventional social conformists and cognitively or philosophically distinct individuals.

This is not a personality quiz.

These tests are rooted in a radical philosophical premise: that many people exist in entirely separate psychological and existential paradigms, often invisible to one another. One adapts to the social game, the other rejects it. The Social Game Typology project is here to make that difference explicit.

# ⚙️ Requirements

Python 3

# 🔧 How to use

Run the "normie_vs_outlier_typology_quiz.py" script first:

`python3 normie_vs_outlier_typology_quiz.py`

If your result is "Normie", then you're done. If your result is "Outlier", run the second "outlier_typology_quiz.py" script for more greater detail:

`python3 outlier_typology_quiz.py`

# 🧠 Value Axes Behind the Tests

Each test is built upon seven key social value dimensions that separate “Outliers” from the mainstream paradigm:

    Authenticity
    → Earned substance vs. surface image

    Emotional Integrity
    → Truthful connection vs. emotional flattery and seduction tactics

    Lucidity
    → Clarity and meaning vs. nihilistic sentimentality or comfort-seeking

    Discourse
    → Dialectical truth vs. rhetorical games

    Candor
    → Radical honesty vs. evasive, strategic ambiguity

    Autonomy
    → Independent merit vs. tribal belonging

    Intimacy
    → Sacred love and shared values vs. romantic performance and theatrics
