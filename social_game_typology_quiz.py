You tend to align closely with the prevailing values, beliefs, and behaviors of the society around you.
Fitting in and maintaining social harmony are likely important priorities in your life, and you may naturally defer to established customs, traditions, or mainstream opinions rather than challenging or questioning them.

You might find comfort in shared experiences, community norms, and widely accepted viewpoints, preferring not to risk social friction by diverging from the majority.
Authenticity and independent thought may still matter to you on some level, but they are often subordinated to the need for belonging, acceptance, or avoiding conflict.

Critical self-examination and independent value formation may not be central focuses in your personal development. Instead, you may draw your sense of right, wrong, success, and meaning more from the expectations and validations of the group than from internally derived standards.

This orientation can provide stability, predictability, and a strong sense of community.
