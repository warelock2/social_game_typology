Outliers live by inner truth rather than social approval. 
You likely prefer mental clarity, radical honesty, and meaningful connection 
over performance, emotional games, or surface-level validation.

You prioritize:

- Authenticity: Earned truth and substance rather than surface, manufactured image
- Emotional Integrity: True connection and honesty over manipulative flattery
- Lucidity: Understanding and intellectual integrity over sentimental comfort
- Discourse: Truth-seeking dialogue over rhetorical manipulation
- Candor: Clear signals and honesty over evasion and ambiguity
- Autonomy: Individual standards over herd belonging
- Intimacy: Sacred partnerships over romantic bait-and-switch

Normies feel at home in the mainstream. You likely prioritize harmony, social approval, 
emotional ease, and conventional norms over challenging truths or abstract ideals. 
You may value fitting in, comfort, and mutual flattery more than deep candor or mental intensity.

- Surface Appearance: Social image over earned depth
- Emotional Ease: Avoiding discomfort over truth
- Sentimental Familiarity: Comfort over intellectual rigor
- Rhetoric: Social harmony over rigorous debate
- Evasion: Ambiguity and "niceness" over directness
- Herd Approval: Belonging over individuality
