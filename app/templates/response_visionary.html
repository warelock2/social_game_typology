Category: ðŸ”­ Visionary

Description:  

The Visionary exhibits behaviors and ideas that prefigure future 
social norms. Their thinking often challenges foundational 
assumptions of the culture they inhabit. They may not always be 
understood, but they operate with a sense of inner necessity and 
clarity.

Figures:

- Nikola Tesla â€“ Imagined technologies and paradigms well ahead of
  his time, largely misunderstood in his era.
- Elon Musk â€“ A norm-defying innovator who bends industries and public 
  discourse to his will, often at the cost of conventional behavior or 
  emotional attunement.
- Jiddu Krishnamurti â€“ Rejected organized religion and traditional 
  structures of authority in favor of direct personal insight.

Traits:

- Holds and communicates insights ahead of mainstream comprehension
- May feel alienated but self-assured
- Strong focus on meaning, truth, and personal evolution
- Unwilling to compromise core convictions for social approval
- Viewed by others as intense, original, or unconventional

Social Role:  

A cultural prototype. Visionaries rarely fit cleanly into existing 
categories and often act as seers, creatives, or radical reformers.
They influence indirectly by modeling a way of being that others 
can feel, even if they can't yet name.
